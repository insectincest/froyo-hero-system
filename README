1: framework taken from Nexus; replaced res with SDK, since Nexus only
   had hdpi
2: apps are a mix of Nexus and SDK, since Nexus is hdpi only
3: bin and lib are from Hero, with bits from Eris and Sprint. These are
   STABLE on a 2.1 aosp ROM.

ISSUES:
Freeze after a few minutes/seconds. 
WiFi switches on.
Taskbar pulldown doesn't work.

I haven't had the time to look into the Kernel yet;
The standard 568 and 1236 kernels work.
Use those, or the 2.6.29 eris-reverse-patched
